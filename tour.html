        <div class="start"><h2>Getting to Egypt</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest and most common logistical questions <br> that future visitors  to Egypt have is how to get there. <br> For nearly all travelers, you’ll almost certainly fly into <br> the country,although very few do cross the land border <br> from Israel into  Taba, Egypt. But compared to the total <br> number of international visitors to Egypt, those who come <br> in by land are very far and few between.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="start"><h2>Visiting the Pyramids</h2>
            <p>The Pyramids of Giza in Egypt are the only one <br> of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World to <br> survive into the modern era. Everything else has <br> vanished or crumbled or been destroyed by <br> man or nature, yet these massive monuments have <br> stood the test of time and are still standing today.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="start"><h2>What to see & do in Luxor</h2>
        <p>Luxor is Egypt’s number two destination for visitors <br> after the greater Cairo/Giza area further north. <br> Luxor is the area I call the land of tombs and <br> temples because, while there are certainly tombs <br> and temples all over Egypt, Luxor is where the most <br> magnificent ones are located.</p></div>
        <div class="start"><h2>Visiting the Egyptian Museum</h2>
        <p>There are lots of museums in Egypt and in Cairo and lots <br> of museums around the world with Egyptian artifacts, but <br> no other museum in the world contains such an extensive <br> collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts as this one in Cairo, <br> Egypt. And perhaps more remarkably, nowhere else in the world <br> can you get as close and intimate with Egyptian history as you <br> can in this particular museum.</p></div>
        <div class="start"><h2>Where to go Egypt’s Red Sea Coast</h2>
        <p>When we refer to Egypt’s Red Sea coast with respect <br> to tourism,  we’re really talking about two main areas – <br> the eastern coastal portion of Egypt on the African <br> continent, or what I call Egypt proper, and the eastern coast <br> of the Sinai Peninsula.</p></div>
        <div class="start"><h2>Exploring Aswan & Abu Simbel</h2>
        <p>Southern Egypt, also known as Upper Egypt, is most famous <br> for the scores of majestic ancient temples that still line the shores <br> of the Nile River for hundreds of miles. Of all the towns and villages <br> in this region, Aswan is the largest in the far south of Egypt and <br> a favorite base from which travelers have set out to visit and explore <br> these ruins for thousands of years. And of all of the temple ruins reachable <br> from Aswan, Abu Simbel is by far the largest and most famous of them all.</p></div>
