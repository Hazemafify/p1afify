                    As we make clear on every page of this site, this is NOT the official site of the GEM (which doesn’t exist yet) but rather a third-party informational site about the new museum’s progress with news related to its construction. We are NOT affiliated with either the government of Egypt or the GEM itself, so we cannot answer questions about specific opening dates, contracting, etc. If you’d like to be notified as soon as we know more about the GEM’s opening, Sign Up To Be Notified here to receive our updates as they become available.
